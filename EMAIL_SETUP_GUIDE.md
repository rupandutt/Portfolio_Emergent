# Email Setup Guide for Production

## Current Status
âœ… **Contact form is fully functional** - All submissions are being processed, validated, and logged
âœ… **Resume download is working** - PDF file is served correctly
âœ… **LinkedIn links are fixed** - No more JavaScript errors

## Email Notifications
Currently, email notifications are being **logged to the console** for development purposes. You can see them in the backend logs:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log
```

When someone submits the contact form, you'll see:
- ðŸ“§ EMAIL SENT to duttard27@gmail.com (notification)
- ðŸ“§ EMAIL SENT to [sender email] (auto-response)

## Setting Up Real Email Delivery

### Option 1: Gmail SMTP (Quick Setup)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password: Google Account â†’ Security â†’ App passwords
3. Add to `/app/backend/.env`:
```
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```
4. Uncomment SMTP code in `/app/backend/email_service.py`

### Option 2: Professional Email Service (Recommended)
**SendGrid** (Free tier: 100 emails/day)
```bash
pip install sendgrid
```

**Mailgun** (Free tier: 5,000 emails/month)
```bash
pip install requests
```

**AWS SES** (Pay-per-use, very reliable)
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### Option 3: Webhook Integration
Set up a webhook service like Zapier or Make.com to forward form submissions to your email.

## Testing Email Delivery
1. Submit a test form at `/contact`
2. Check backend logs for confirmation
3. Look for emails in your inbox (when real email is configured)

## Production Deployment Notes
- All form submissions are stored in MongoDB
- Rate limiting prevents spam (3 submissions per hour per IP)
- Form validation works on both frontend and backend
- Professional HTML email templates are ready
